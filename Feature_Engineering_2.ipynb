        "The Filter method in feature selection involves selecting features based on their statistical properties, independent of any specific machine learning algorithm. It works by ranking features using metrics such as correlation coefficients, chi-square tests, mutual information, or variance. Features that meet a predefined threshold or ranking criteria are selected for the model."

        "The Wrapper method evaluates the performance of feature subsets by training and testing a machine learning model. It considers interactions between features and the model's performance. Unlike the Filter method, which is model-independent, the Wrapper method is computationally intensive because it involves repeatedly fitting the model for different feature subsets.\n",
