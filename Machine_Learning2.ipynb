    " Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem too simplistically, while variance is the error introduced by too much complexity. The relationship is a tradeoff; as you decrease bias, variance tends to increase, and vice versa. Model performance is affected as finding the right balance is crucial â€“ an overly complex model may fit the training data perfectly but fail to generalize to new data (high variance), and an overly simple model may not capture the underlying patterns (high bias)."
