        "Q1. What is multiprocessing in Python? Why is it useful?\n",
        "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to create multiple processes to execute tasks concurrently. Each process runs independently and has its own memory space, allowing true parallelism.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why is it useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "Parallelism: Ideal for CPU-bound tasks as it allows multiple processes to run simultaneously, taking advantage of multi-core processors.\n",
        "Isolation: Each process has its own memory space, preventing data corruption due to shared memory issues.\n",

        "Q2. Differences Between Multiprocessing and Multithreading\n",
        "Execution Model:\n",
        "Multiprocessing achieves true parallelism by running multiple processes on different CPU cores. Each process operates independently with its own memory space. In contrast, multithreading uses multiple threads within the same process, which share the same memory and are limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, preventing true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory Usage:\n",
        "In multiprocessing, each process has its own memory space, making it more isolated and safer from memory corruption but requiring more memory. Multithreading shares the same memory space, which is more memory-efficient but can lead to issues like race conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overhead:\n",
        "Creating and managing processes in multiprocessing has higher overhead compared to threads due to the cost of spawning new processes and inter-process communication. Multithreading has lower overhead as threads are lightweight and share the same resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Cases:\n",
        "Multiprocessing is best suited for CPU-bound tasks like numerical computations or data processing. On the other hand, multithreading is ideal for I/O-bound tasks such as network operations, file handling, or database interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Debugging Complexity:\n",
        "Debugging multiprocessing code is often simpler since processes are isolated. Multithreading can be more challenging to debug due to shared memory, which increases the chances of encountering race conditions and deadlocks."
